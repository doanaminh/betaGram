# betaGram
An interactive video sharing platform where climbers can share their "betas", or climbing tutorials, for certain climbing routes. Share, upload, and watch betas for routes that you may be having a hard time figuring out!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MERN stack

Building from the ground up, this application was a culmination of all the things I've learned and my passion for rock climbing. Besides coding I am an avid climber and creating something that may help the community drove me to create this app. Often times climbers are trying to figure out a certain climb that may not be progressing so well. This application will be able to help if there are videos of that particular climb that they are working on.

## Optimizations

Used bootstrap to make everything responsive. Optimized server side code to fetch media faster than prior versions.

## Lessons Learned:

On completion of this application my level of understanding of databases communication increased greatly. The way that the front end interacts with the back end really clicked for me throughout this project. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
